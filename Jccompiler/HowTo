Make sure you have java
you can check with:
	java --version

	(I have openjdk 11.0.6 2020-01-14)

Install javacc
	sudo apt-get install javacc

Write the jj file, you will define a class (such as Parser) which will handle the input
The class name is arbitrary but should reflect functionality.

To compile a jj file:
	javacc jjfileame.jj

It should generate a bunch of java files if successful, then compile them
	javac *.java

Run the compiled class defined in the jj file (probably parser)
	java Parser (input)

It will do what it does based on how the Parser class was defined.
In the future, we will augment the output classes to integrate them into our project
